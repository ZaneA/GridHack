# GridHack

A quick grid based window layout thing. Similar to apps like Divvy (only really rough).

## Usage

Commented C# source is there to muck around with but the usage is simple. When run the app listens to a global hotkey (WIN + ~), shows a window with a DataGrid above the hovered window, and you can drag across the cells you want the window to occupy. Throw the binary into your startup folder and forget about it.
